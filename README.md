Step 1: Update the Data
        First, fix the data by updating the Admissions table:

        Change attending_doctor_id from 3 to 29.

        Change patient_id from 35 to 4.

Step 2: Solve the Tasks
        Doctors with Admissions:

        Find doctors who are linked to at least one admission.

Doctors without Admissions:

Find doctors who are not linked to any admissions.

Patients with Missing Doctor Details:

Find patients whose admissions are linked to a non-existent doctor.

How It Works:

Use JOINs to connect tables (Doctors, Patients, and Admissions).

Use LEFT JOIN to include all records, even if thereâ€™s no match.

Use WHERE to filter results (e.g., find missing doctor details)
